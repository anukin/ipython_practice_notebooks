# Practice notebooks

This will mainly deal with notebooks where certain analysis will be uploaded to make conclusions based on some data set. This is done so that it is easy to go through the process again if require. We wil be individually dealing with different datasets and questions asked within ipython notebooks

## Airbnb listing dataset
In this dataset, airbnb have provided us with dataset of different listing including the price, review, neighborhood etc. With this dataset it may/may not be possible to answer questions such as:

1. Does price of the property affect the review score?
2. Does cancellation policy affect the review score?
3. The most expensive neighborhood?
4. Does host listings count affect the review score?

Please go through the notebook and let me know if something is off.
